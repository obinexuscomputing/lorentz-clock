# TODO: Milestone Requirements for @obinexuscomputing/lorentz-clock  

## Milestone 1: Project Setup  
- [ ] Initialize the NPM package with the name `@obinexuscomputing/lorentz-clock`.  
- [ ] Set up the project repository with Git and connect it to a remote (e.g., GitHub or GitLab).  
- [ ] Configure project tools:  
  - [ ] Add `TypeScript` for type safety.  
  - [ ] Integrate `Gulp` for build automation.  
  - [ ] Include `Git-FTP` for deployment (if needed).  
- [ ] Add a basic README file with:  
  - Project description.  
  - Installation and usage instructions.  
  - Contribution guidelines.  

## Milestone 2: Core Functionality Development  
- [ ] Implement Lorentz factor calculations (`γ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²)`).  
- [ ] Add support for time dilation calculations based on relative velocity.  
- [ ] Integrate geospatial data for time and spatial synchronization.  
- [ ] Develop APIs for:  
  - [ ] Time transformation.  
  - [ ] Spatial transformations.  
  - [ ] Synchronization between multiple geolocations.  

## Milestone 3: Testing and Validation  
- [ ] Set up testing framework (e.g., Jest).  
- [ ] Write unit tests for core functions:  
  - [ ] Lorentz factor computation.  
  - [ ] Time dilation effects.  
- [ ] Validate calculations with real-world or simulated data.  
- [ ] Achieve at least 90% test coverage.  

## Milestone 4: Optimization and Enhancements  
- [ ] Optimize performance for handling large datasets.  
- [ ] Add support for various coordinate systems (e.g., Cartesian, GPS).  
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with browser and Node.js environments.  
- [ ] Provide comprehensive error handling and logging.  

## Milestone 5: Documentation  
- [ ] Create a detailed API reference in the README.  
- [ ] Include examples and use cases.  
- [ ] Add comments and annotations to the source code.  

## Milestone 6: Packaging and Deployment  
- [ ] Add a `package.json` file with correct metadata (author, license, etc.).  
- [ ] Configure NPM publishing scripts.  
- [ ] Publish the first version on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com).  

## Milestone 7: Community and Feedback  
- [ ] Announce the package on relevant developer forums (e.g., Dev.to, Reddit).  
- [ ] Gather feedback and feature requests from users.  
- [ ] Address any reported bugs or issues.  

## Milestone 8: Future Improvements  
- [ ] Explore advanced relativistic corrections (e.g., gravitational time dilation).  
- [ ] Add visualization tools for time and space transformations.  
- [ ] Integrate with geolocation APIs (e.g., Google Maps, OpenStreetMap).
